*Slowly awakes*
Wh-Where am I?
What is this place?
I could have sworn I was just in school
And now I'm in this plac.....
It looks familiar.
This looks just like my school but everything is different
Its dark and cold
Are those.... blood stains?
Ok dont touch those and nothing bad will happen
But that one is kinda close, did I step in it already
I think I did
I did, I did, I did
I'll have to clean my clothes and hands as soon as I can
I need to get out of here.


Oh I know what happened
I must have fell asleep in English class again
I was exhausted
I haven't been sleeping much lately
Or at all really
...
I don't know what is going on lately everything makes me nervous
I'm so stressed
Please wake up, please wake up, please wake up
That didn't work 
I'll keep going

I should be coming up on the P.E. hall if this place is like the school
I hate P.E. recently
Having to change during the day makes me feel unclean
Recently I've spent 20 minutes washing my hands after P.E.
I didn't used to do that but the stress has been too much recently
*Feint Screaming noise*
Wh-what was that?

Barrels
My Barrels
Barrels
Barrels
Barrels
must check my barrels
No one can touch my barrels
BARRELS!!
